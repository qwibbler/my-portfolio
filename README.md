# My Portfolio

> **[This](https://qwibbler.github.io/my-portfolio/)** is a practice portfolio that I am building to learn the required coding skills for building a basic website for both desktop and mobile screens, and to begin setting up my very own portfolio. I will be expanding on this in the various tutorial excersizes as I progress along Microverse.
